				    <h3>Welcome To Our Website</h3>
					<p>
					     Pretty hotel. They started to charge for parking!!! (This was not notify earlier in the booking) They give us room keys that don't work. 
						 ( happens more than one time) The walls don't cancel noise. I could still hear other people talking and in the middle of night. Placed unauthorized
						 charge on the room for no good reason. Had to call to Ask the staff to make it correct, took very long time. Bad attitude also at one point they hung
						 up on us. Iineffective staff that's was rude made the stay even more frustrating. Buffet quality of food, taste and atmosphere had lower dramatically!!!!!

						 the keys before entering the elevators was rude and not at all consistent with who he checked (both in our favor and against). When my husband asked him about it 
						 he was combative and obnoxious.
